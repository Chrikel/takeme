Uni directional data flow is the best data flow: 

![URL -> Application State -> Your View](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/basarat/takeme/master/docs/uni-directional.png)

Saw the other solutions out there, I had two difference of opinions:

* This is built in TypeScript, for TypeScript. Other libraries [will get there eventually](https://basarat.gitbooks.io/typescript/content/docs/why-typescript.html). Till then fighting with out-of-date type definitions was not fun.
* They encourage tangling routing with components. This can be a good idea, but any time I needed more power, I had to do things like wrap my component (which may or may not work with TS classes), imagine props getting passed magically (not very type safe) and jump other hoops like `next` and `done` callbacks.

If existing solutions work well for you (`npm install foo foo-bar @types/foo @types/foo-bar`) *thats okay*. You can move on and live a happy life yet üåπ

> PROTIP: prefer refactorability over magic.

## Demo

[Demo for all of the concepts in practice](http://basarat.com/takeme-demo)


## What does it support

Simple `#/foo` = on match > (`beforeEnter` `enter` `beforeLeave`) management. That's all I really needed. You can map `url` => `state` => `any arbitrary nesting of components` very easily and more maintainably in the long term instead of depending on hidden features of some library.

## Install 

```
npm install takeme --save
```

## Quick 

```js
import {Router, navigate, link} from 'takeme';

/**
 * The router takes an array of RouteConfig objects.
 */
const router = new Router([
  {
    $: '/foo',
    enter: () => {
      appState.fireTheMissiles();
    }
  }
]);

/** 
 * If you want to trigger some `beforeEnter` / `enter` (if it matches)
 */
router.init();

/** To nav. Just a thin wrapper on browser hash / pushstate (if supported) */
navigate('/foo');
/** or replace if pushstate is supported, if not its ignored magically */
navigate('/foo', true);

/** 
 * Use link to get a link. 
 * Just a thin wrapper that adds `#` to a given path
 * e.g. with JSX:
 **/
<a href={link('/foo')}>Take me to foo</a>
```

## Matching on $

### Parameters

Support `:param` for loading sections e.g

```js
{
  $: '/foo/:bar',
  enter: ({params}) => {
    console.log(params); // {bar:'somebar'} üçª
  }
}

// User visits `/foo/somebar`
```
You can have as my params as you want e.g. `/foo/:bar/:baz`.

### Optional

Wrap any section with `()` to mark it as optional. e.g `/foo(/bar)`. In this case both `/foo` and `/foo/bar` match. To escape a `(` you can use a backslash e.g. `/foo\\(\\)` will only match the url `/foo()`.

### Wild card

`*` will match entire sections e.g. `/foo/*` will match `/foo/whatever/you/can/think/of`. The last matched `*` is placed in `params.splat`.

### Wild card greedy

`*` does not match greedily e.g. 

* `/*/c` does not match `/you/are/cool/c` as a single star only eats `/*/cool/c` and the trailing `ool/c` is unmatchd.

If you want such matching use the greedy `**` wildcard e.g.

* `/**/c` matches `/you/are/cool/c`. 

> The difference between `**` vs. `*` is only really evident when you want to match something inside i.e. `/*/c` (inside) vs. `/c/*` (end). In an end position they both behave the same.

## Handlers 

You can specify `beforeEnter`, `enter`, `beforeLeave` handlers. (Of course, you have TypeScript to guide you).

> Path: if `window.location.hash`:`#/foo`, in our lingo `path` is `/foo`.

Example of all these handlers: 

```js
{
  $: '/foo/',
  beforeEnter: ({oldPath, newPath, params}) => void | Promise<{ redirect: string, replace?: boolean }>,
  enter: ({oldPath, newPath, params}) => void,
  beforeLeave: ({oldPath, newPath}): void | false | Promise<{ redirect: string, replace?: boolean }>,
}
```

Lets look at these one by one.

### `beforeEnter` 
Triggered before calling `enter`. 

* This is your chance to go ahead and redirect the user if you want (e.g. if they are not logged in), just return `Promise.resolve({redirect:'/newPath'})`.
* Otherwise just return nothing and we will move on to `enter` (if any).

### `enter`
Yay, they made it. Use the `{oldPath, newPath, params}` to your hearts content.

### `beforeLeave`
The are about to leave. 

* If the `newPath` is not something you like, you can go ahead and return `false` to prevent them moving (be sure to let them know why by adding some notification to your state/UI).
* You can even go ahead and chose to redirect them elsewhere (return `Promise<{ redirect: string, replace?: boolean }>`).

## Ordering Routes
The router takes an array of `RouteConfig` objects. On a route change (browser hash change or pushstate event), we go through these routes one by one. So you can order the routes in decreasing priority e.g. error pages:

```js 
[
  { $: '/foo',
    enter: ()=>{ appState.current = 'foo' } },
  { $: '*', 
    enter: ()=>{ appState.current = 'notfound' } },
]
```

## Tips
Here are some tips. Few of these are really tied to us, but its good to have helpful guidance so here it is.

### Lazy loading
Just use the JavaScript patterns you know and love e.g. with webpack.

```js
{
  $: '/foo/',
  enter: () => { 
    require.ensure(['banana','monkey-holding-the-banana','the-jungle'], ()=>{
      // your app logic
    });
  }
}
```

### Uni-Directional
Now that we have the entire simple API covered, let's talk a bit more about patterns (üïäÔ∏è and üêù). The simplest way to do it is simply to follow the `url -> state -> view` pattern. You can use something like `mobx` or `redux` for `state -> view` pattern. 

* Browser's back / next buttons, or clicking on any link that changes the url will automatically trigger an event we already register to and we map them to the hooks as need. You don't need to do anything here.
* Users actions like a `goToPayment()` action can follow the same pattern as the user clicking the link by simply calling `router.navigate('/payment')` (we just use pushstate or hash change based on detected browser support).

Sweet, its all `url => someHookYouUseToChangeState` ‚ù§Ô∏èÔ∏è.

### Managing links
Links are just `string`. I like to know which are the ones in the app, and keep them easy to maintain (thank to TypeScript). I normally have a file `links.ts` with: 

```js
export const links = {
  login: () => '/login',
  profile: (id: string) => `/profile/${id}`
}
```

This file is my single source of truth.

* I configure my routing using these functions: 

```
const router = new Router({
  [links.login()]: {
    enter:()=>{ /* do your state thing */ }
  },
  [links.profile(':profileId')]: {
    enter:({params})=>{ /* do your state thing with `params.profileId` */ }
  },
});
```

* All calls to `navigate` also use `links` e.g. `navigate(links.profile('dave'))`. 
* For `a` tags, use `link` with `links` e.g. with JSX:

```js
<a href={link(links.profile(user.id))}>{user.name}</a>
```

* For reminder emails (and other static assets) generate the template files using `links`: 

```js
const websiteRoot = 'https://www.github.com/'
const templateVars = {
  userId: '{{userId}}'
};
const link = websiteRoot + link(links.profile(templateVars));
```

Of course you can use this `links.ts` in your dynamic server code as well. This way you don't get bad link refactorings (magic strings).
